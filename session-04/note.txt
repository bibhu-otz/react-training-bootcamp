JavaScript Scope :

  - Global Scope
   
  - Function Scope

  - Local Scope

  var x =10;
  function Sum(n1,n2)
  {
      var y=80;
      console.log(x);
  }
 function Sub(n1,n2)
  {
      var z=90;
      console.log(x);
      console.log(y);
  }


  - What is Variable Hoisting ?

    When we create  any variable using var keyword inside any local block then all the variable declaration automatically
    move the top of the function.

    Hoisting is a mechanism in JS through which all the declaration is moving to the top od the scope it may be gloabla scope or function scope.



  - In JS when the code is executing it undergoes into two phase (Execution Context)

    a. Declaration Phase (Creation)

    b. Execution Phase  (Execution)


  - What is the difference between var and let,const keyword ?

    - var was old approach
    - let and const introduced in ES6

    - var is hoisted
    - let doesn't hoisted

    - var is function scoped
    - let is local scoped

    - we can create multiple variable with same name using var keyword with a scope
    - We can not create multiple variable with same name using let keyword with a scope.

    - It is always suggestd that use let keyword to declarare variable in JS/React



=> JavaScript is dynamic typed language

   The variable type is decided during run time.i.e the type of value we assign to the varibale.

   let num = 5;
